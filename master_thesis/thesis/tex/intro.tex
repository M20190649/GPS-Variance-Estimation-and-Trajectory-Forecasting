\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

% Smartphones have given hackers new appealing attack vectors to exploit \cite{Nokia2016}.
% One of these attack vectors is the publishing of malicious applications that act like benevolent ones.
% These applications are commonly referred to as Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs) \cite{PHA}.
% For example, PHAs could be disguised Trojans stealing the consumer's contact information, opening backdoors on the infected device or even sending SMS messages \cite{current-android-malware}.

% Google releases annual Android security reports covering different security aspects tackled throughout the year.
% In Google's Android security report from 2015 \cite{android-security-2015}, they stated that "less than 0.5\% of devices had a PHA installed" and that this number was 0.15\% for devices that only installed applications from Google's own application store, Google Play\footnote{https://play.google.com/store?hl=en}.
% In Google's review of 2016 \cite{android-security-2016} the average increased to 0.71\% of devices, while the percentage was reduced to 0.05\% for the devices installing exclusively from Google Play.
% The increase of PHAs in devices installing applications from other sources than Google Play is interesting, as it might be indicative of a change in user behaviour, or the result of an increase of PHAs in other application stores.
% It is, however, clear that the threat from PHAs still exists in 2017.

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem-description}
% The problem of malware existed long before the invention of smartphones.
% The antivirus (AV) industry has been combatting this issue for decades.
% Modern AV software use different approaches, like signature-based detection or heuristics, to detect malware in computers.
% One of the problems with signature-based detection is the tools available for hackers to alter the code of a malicious programme, which would change the signature of the programme.
% This could, for example, be done by using metamorphic virology \cite{metamorphic-virology}.
% The heuristic approach tries to capture the essence of malicious programmes and group similar malware together.
% The grouping is done by manually engineering generic signatures for the malware.
% This manual labour required to engineer generic signatures, together with the rapid evolution of malware, make heuristics an infeasible long-term solution.
% Today, effort is put into using machine learning algorithms to detect malware.
% Some of the algorithms used are: Naive Bayes (NB) classifier \cite{Shang2017}, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF) classifiers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \cite{McLaughlin2017}. 

\section{Aim}
\label{sec:aim}
% This work aims to use the NB, SVMs, RF classifiers and CNNs to detect malicious Android Package Kits (APKs).
% The algorithms are implemented and then evaluated by comparing their accuracy (the fraction of malicious APKs found) with the number of false positives (benign APKs falsely flagged as malicious).
% The specific metrics used are covered in Section \ref{sec:eval-metrics}.
% The classifiers use static APK features for training, validation and testing.

\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research-questions}
% This work explicitly answers the following questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item How does the NB classifier perform compared to SVMs or RF classifiers with respect to accuracy and precision?
%   \item How can static APK features be used to train a CNN?
%   \item How do CNNs perform compared to NB, SVMs and RF classifiers, with respect to accuracy and precision?
%   \item Which features, other than static APK features, could potentially be useful when classifying malicious applications?
% \end{enumerate}

\section{Delimitations}
\label{sec:delimitations}
% Only static APK features are used for actual training; the discussion of alternative features is only theoretical.
% The specific implementations used of the NB classifiers, SVMs, RF classifiers and CNNs are not covered in detail.
% However, the parameters chosen for each algorithm are presented and discussed in detail.
% Algorithms are only evaluated based on their accuracy and the number of false positives classified.
