\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

% Smartphones have given hackers new appealing attack vectors to exploit \cite{Nokia2016}.
% One of these attack vectors is the publishing of malicious applications that act like benevolent ones.
% These applications are commonly referred to as Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs) \cite{PHA}.
% For example, PHAs could be disguised Trojans stealing the consumer's contact information, opening backdoors on the infected device or even sending SMS messages \cite{current-android-malware}.

% Google releases annual Android security reports covering different security aspects tackled throughout the year.
% In Google's Android security report from 2015 \cite{android-security-2015}, they stated that "less than 0.5\% of devices had a PHA installed" and that this number was 0.15\% for devices that only installed applications from Google's own application store, Google Play\footnote{https://play.google.com/store?hl=en}.
% In Google's review of 2016 \cite{android-security-2016} the average increased to 0.71\% of devices, while the percentage was reduced to 0.05\% for the devices installing exclusively from Google Play.
% The increase of PHAs in devices installing applications from other sources than Google Play is interesting, as it might be indicative of a change in user behaviour, or the result of an increase of PHAs in other application stores.
% It is, however, clear that the threat from PHAs still exists in 2017.

Maintenance of devices/vehicles/systems/machines (hereinafter referred to as “units”) is generally done by planned scheduling. 
Typically this is done when some parameter of the system reaches a threshold value. 
For example, car maintenance can be scheduled after 30,000 kilometres, after a year or perhaps after a certain number of operating hours.
One problem with planned scheduling is the reliance on experience and statistics from many units.
For a single unit, the planned scheduling will either be executed too early (could have waited longer before service) or too late (problems encountered before threshold reached).

Internet of Things (IoT) permits the streaming of continuous data from multiple units.
The data is typically the state of the unit in the shape of many different variable values.
A rule framework can be built incorporating the continuous data.
The framework can then give an informed service alert based on the actual state and need of a unit.

Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to, for example, capture dependencies in large-scale data sets (ref needed), anomaly detection (ref), clustering (ref), image recognition (ref), and decision making (ref). 
Anomaly detection could be used together with continuous real-time data from a system to find unusual changes or behaviour, which could be the basis for a service alert and/or the gathering of new knowledge about a system.
ML-algorithms can also be used to perform Predictive Maintenance (PdM).

\section{Background}

\subsection{Maintenance Techniques}
There are different techniques to carry out maintenance work, each with various drawbacks and benefits.
Corrective Maintenance (CM) is the technique to identify, isolate, and solve faults.
The aim of CM is to restore the faulty equipment to working conditions.
CM can only be done after a fault has been detected and is a reactive approach to maintenance.
The fault detection can be carried out without the need of expensive, or extensive, equipment to monitor the health of a system.
On the other hand, such equipment can help during the fault identification and isolation steps. \todo{source}
The faults typically require costly repairs or equipment replacement, as small failures might not be detected until a major fault occurs.

Another technique is Preventive Maintenance (PM).
PM focuses on proactive maintenance of equipment by carefully monitoring and servicing equipment by expert personnel.
The goal is to maintain satisfactory operating conditions of the system by solving minor faults before they cause major ones.
PM requires good knowledge about the system and regular, systematic inspections to be carried out.
% Dyrt att underhålla på detta vis, men leder kanske ofta till att system inte går ner lika mycket som i CM (då system alltid går ner innan problem fixas)
% Valet mellan dessa beror på industrin du arbetar inom.

The technique which will be explored in this thesis is Predictive Maintenance (PdM).
The aim of PdM is to optimise scheduled maintenance work and minimise, or even prevent, unexpected equipment failures.
Equipment is directly monitored and measured to understand the actual maintenance need.
Maintenance can then be scheduled for a specific equipment, based on the actual need.

\subsection{Internet of Things}
The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in various industries indirectly solve the problem of data gathering and equipment monitoring.
For example, data is typically integrated in IoT applications to provide direct system control, statistical features, localisation or planning.  

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem-description}

Systems with a Corrective Maintenance (CM) policy typically suffer from expensive repairs and system downtime due to faults.
Preventive Maintenance (PM) can suffer from premature repairs and replacement of equipment.
Premature repairs and replacements do not only lead to greater costs but also a larger environmental stamp. 
Predictive Maintenance (PdM) aims at solving both issues.
By monitoring the actual need of a system, premature maintenance can be avoided and minor faults detected and solved.
However, PdM requires direct monitoring of equipment, which might not be easily achievable in traditional industries.
Internet of Things (IoT) applications solve the monitoring problem by continuously gathering data and collecting it.
This work focuses on the usage of IoT data to realise PdM.
The goal is to implement PdM to reduce costs associated with repairs of faulty equipment, premature replacement of equipment, and unnecessary maintenance services.

% The problem of malware existed long before the invention of smartphones.
% The antivirus (AV) industry has been combatting this issue for decades.
% Modern AV software use different approaches, like signature-based detection or heuristics, to detect malware in computers.
% One of the problems with signature-based detection is the tools available for hackers to alter the code of a malicious programme, which would change the signature of the programme.
% This could, for example, be done by using metamorphic virology \cite{metamorphic-virology}.
% The heuristic approach tries to capture the essence of malicious programmes and group similar malware together.
% The grouping is done by manually engineering generic signatures for the malware.
% This manual labour required to engineer generic signatures, together with the rapid evolution of malware, make heuristics an infeasible long-term solution.
% Today, effort is put into using machine learning algorithms to detect malware.
% Some of the algorithms used are: Naive Bayes (NB) classifier \cite{Shang2017}, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF) classifiers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \cite{McLaughlin2017}. 

\section{Aim}
\label{sec:aim}
The aim of the work is to perform a case-study on how Machine Leaning (ML) algorithms can be used on Internet of Things (IoT) data for Predictive Maintenance (PdM).
The study shall compare at least two different ML algorithms.
The goal is to implement the ML algorithms and use real-world data from an existing IoT system.
The case-study shall also compare how well PdM performs against the Corrective Maintenance approach used in the IoT application today.

% This work aims to use the NB, SVMs, RF classifiers and CNNs to detect malicious Android Package Kits (APKs).
% The algorithms are implemented and then evaluated by comparing their accuracy (the fraction of malicious APKs found) with the number of false positives (benign APKs falsely flagged as malicious).
% The specific metrics used are covered in Section \ref{sec:eval-metrics}.
% The classifiers use static APK features for training, validation and testing.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What methods can be used to detect anomalies in a dynamic real-time system?
  \item How can the need for maintenance be detected from real-time processing of domain-specific data?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:delimitations}
The data available is from an existing IoT application mainly used to control units.
The available sensors in the application can not be changed and additional sensors can not be added.

% Only static APK features are used for actual training; the discussion of alternative features is only theoretical.
% The specific implementations used of the NB classifiers, SVMs, RF classifiers and CNNs are not covered in detail.
% However, the parameters chosen for each algorithm are presented and discussed in detail.
% Algorithms are only evaluated based on their accuracy and the number of false positives classified.
