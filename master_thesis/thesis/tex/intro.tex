\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research-questions}
This work explicitly answers the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{}
  \item What methods can be used to detect anomalies in a dynamic real-time system?
  \item How can the need for maintenance be detected from real-time processing of domain-specific data?
  \item How can Predictive Maintenance be achieved by processing real-time domain-specific data?
  \item How many days in advance can maintenance be predicted?
  \item How can Predictive Maintenance be evaluated and compared to Corrective Maintenance?
  \item How can faults be identified and isolated using Predictive Maintenance?
  \item What data is required to realise fault identification and fault isolation in Predictive Maintenance?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Delimitations}
\label{sec:delimitations}
The data available is from an existing IoT application mainly used to control units.
The available sensors in the application can not be changed and additional sensors can not be added.
